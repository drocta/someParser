# someParser
This is based on http://lisperator.net/pltut/ but it is in python instead, and other things are different.

Whatever licencing that I am obligated to apply to this because of this being partially based on that applies.

However, its in a different programming language, and most of it will be changed, so I don't know how much that is.

This is some parser. Or, rather, right now all it is is a tokenizer/lexer . But it will probably have a parser also at some point. My intent is to use it for another thing later. (it is a sekret to everyone).

My previous tokenizing things have been sloppy, which is why I am trying to do it right, instead of using my old tokenizing stuff.

I'm not 100% sure that I'm able to grant you license to this, because I couldn't find a license on http://lisperator.net/pltut/ , and this is at least so far mainly a translation of that to python.

So, take caution with regards to that.
